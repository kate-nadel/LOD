# LOD

In this repository are two versions of ttl data modeled from the MoMA's collection documenting the relationship between the exhibition "CÃ¨zanne, Gauguin, Seurat, Van Gogh" and the four artists noted in the title (among other pieces of relevant data). The context for this is to illustrate what linked data would look like for the MoMA's exhibition history data. 

I've been using Linked Art's documentation and the (Van Gogh Worldwide's Github)[https://github.com/vangoghworldwide/linkedart] as models for this work, and am now hoping to receive some feedback about how best to express this kind of data in ttl.

Thank you!
